 <button id="button1" onclick="window.location.href='https:whatever.com/';">Sign Up</button>

This an example of how to get the button to be clicked and have it send you to another page.



.content{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
    background-image: url(../images/vacation.jpg);
    background-size: cover;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    height: 100vh;


    This has the way that I got my Background Image to take the entire page.  This can be made better though
